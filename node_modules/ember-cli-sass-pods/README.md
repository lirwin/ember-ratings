Enjoy styling your pods with the sass style file in the pod directory.

## What is ember-cli-sass-pods?
Say you have a contacts route and contact-box component.
##### Generate regular route and component:
```
ember g route contacts -p
ember g component contact-box -p
```
##### Then, use ember-cli-sass-pods power and generate styles:
```
ember g style contacts -p
ember g style components/contact-box -p
```

##### Your awesome file structure would be:
```
app/

app/contacts
app/contacts/route.js
app/contacts/template.hbs
app/contacts/style.scss

app/components/
app/components/contact-box
app/components/contact-box/component.js
app/components/contact-box/template.hbs
app/components/contact-box/style.scss

app/styles/
app/styles/app.scss
app/styles/[importFileName].scss
```
##### app/styles/[importFileName].scss
```
@import "contacts/style";
@import "components/contact-box/style";
```

* `ember install ember-cli-sass-pods`
